# ML-with-Sentinel

Machine learning to assist with threat hunting using logs from Microsoft Sentinel.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Understanding
- **Collect logs** from Microsoft Sentinel or any other logging system.
- **Understand** the structure and content of the logs.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Clean the data** by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.
- **Feature engineering** to extract relevant features from the logs.

### 3. Data Splitting
- **Split the data** into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

### 4. Model Selection
- **Choose appropriate machine learning models** based on the problem type (e.g., anomaly detection, classification).

### 5. Model Training
- **Train the model** using the training data.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- **Evaluate the model** using the testing data to assess its performance.

### 7. Model Tuning
- **Tune the model hyperparameters** to improve performance.

### 8. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Deploy the model** for real-time threat detection and continuously monitor its performance.
